# upper-deck-scout
Rank players by abilities

Social media site allowing users to promote or demote NBA players by skillset. Tentatively planning to use Javascript/Express backend with a React frontend.
Database: SQL or MongoDB? Will decide when ERD is finished.

API in the future:Â https://www.balldontlie.io/#introduction
Start with nodemon: $nodemon server.js

Try it with MongoDB/Mongo Atlas? Easy to update schemas as scope grows without significant re-work. Would like O-Auth but JWT is probably easier given docs. Keep it simple for now.

React starts at local 3000. Must be in the upper-deck-scount folder for react (the low-level folder)

`npm start` to begin, but must be in the right upper-deck folder! Lower folder.

Screen will update on save.
